# Folder contents
The "analysis" folder contains all scripts for pre-processing and analyzing the data as well as for creating figures.

Python scripts are sorted alphabetically by prefixes. Run them in the indicated order to replicate results in the order they appear in the article. 

# How to run
Download the entire repository and keep the folder structure intact, then run the desired script as is.

The only change you need to make to any of the scripts is inserting the name of the experiment you want to analyze; names correspond to the three experiment data folder names.
